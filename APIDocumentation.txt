Chrome Extension Project Documentation
=====================================

Overview
------------

This Chrome Extension project is designed to provide a brief explanation on how to make Chrome Extensions with normal HTML, CSS, and JS, and jQuery.

Components and Modules
-------------------------

- index.html: The main HTML file that contains the basic structure of the extension's popup.
- bootstrap/bootstrap.bundle.min.js: The Bootstrap JavaScript bundle used for styling and layout.
- bootstrap/jquery-3.2.1.min.js: The jQuery library used for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- assets/extension.png: The icon used for the extension.
- README.md: This documentation file.

Flow and Workflows
---------------------

- User Interaction:
	+ The user clicks on the extension's icon in the Chrome toolbar.
	+ The popup is displayed, showing the HTML content from `index.html`.
	+ The user can interact with the popup, clicking on buttons or links.
- API Calls:
	+ The extension makes API calls to external services (not implemented in this example).
	+ The API calls are handled using JavaScript and jQuery.

Infrastructure and Deployment
